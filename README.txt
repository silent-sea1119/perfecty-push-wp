Self-hosted Push Notifications using your own server for free!

== Description ==
[Perfecty Push WP](https://github.com/rwngallego/perfecty-push-wp) is a Wordpress plugin for Perfecty Push,
an Open Source project that allows you to send Web Push notifications
directly from your own server: No hidden fees, no third-party dependencies and you own your data.

Features:

- Open Source and self-hosted
- No third-party dependencies when self-hosted
- Offline browser notifications through [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) (Safari is not supported yet)
- You retain and own the user authorization tokens
- WordPress plugin with a built-in PHP Push Server based on [web-push-php](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php)
- Send notifications when publishing posts

Requirements:
- PHP 7.1+
- The gmp extension.

**Note**: Support for `PHP 7.1` will be drop in the mid-term, so the `gmp` extension

This plugin uses the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library for the admin stats charts.
